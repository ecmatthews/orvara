# Each row: mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution
# used to initialize the parameter given in the comment.  For the
# masses and semimajor axes of the companions, and for the jitter, the
# distributions used are lognormal.  In these cases the standard
# deviations are of the natural log about the distribution peak.  In
# all cases, realizations of the distributions that result in
# unphysical parameters or combinations of parameters will be
# automatically adjusted.

   1          0.5   # jitter (m/s, lognormal)
   1          0.2   # primary mass (Msun)

# Companion #1 (indexed as companion 0 in relative astrometry)
#
   0.04       0.3   # mass (Msun, lognormal)
   33         6     # semimajor axis (AU, lognormal)
   0.4        0.2   # sqrt(ecc)*sin(omega)
   -0.2       0.3   # sqrt(ecc)*cos(omega)
   0.5        0.3   # inclination (radians, valid region 0->pi)
   3.2        0.1   # long asc node (rad, valid -pi->3pi)
   0.8        0.2   # long at reference epoch (rad, valid -pi->3pi)

# Companion #2 (indexed as companion 1 in relative astrometry) [if you
# have a second companion, put its guesses below as for companion 1]
# The number of parameters given in this file *must* be a match to the
# number of companions that you specify in the configuration file.  It
# should have the same rows, with the same parameter descriptions, as
# for the first companion listed above.
